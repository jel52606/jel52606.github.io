<h3>History of the British Labrador</h3>
</div>
<p>
The dogs which have now become known as labradors were first used in the Canadien province of Newfoundland as "fishing dogs", and at the time called St. John's Water Dogs.  They would swim out to nets that had been cast out by fishermen, and drag them back to the boat. They were also known to catch the occasional fish in their mouths. They got their name "Labrador" from their place of work, the Labrador Sea.  This reputation interested the 5th Duke of Buccleuch in Scotland, who was one of the first to import and breed these dogs in the 1830s for the purpose of retrieving game on the large english-style driven shoots. Below can be found a link to the website for Buccleuch Gundogs.

<p>Thanks to certain breeders in the United States, these dogs have become quite popular and well known in the sporting community.  They are commonly used in the United States by duck hunters and upland bird hunters alike.  In duck hunting, the dog will wait patiently until ducks are shot and will then be sent to retrieve them.  In upland bird hunting, the dog can be trained to flush bird out of deep cover, and then be sent to retrieve them once they are shot.

<p>The staple of the British Labrador is that they are known as "The Gentleman's Gundog".  This name was coined my Mike Stewart, Founder of Wildrose Kennels.  The name speaks to the dual nature of the British Lab.  Its temperament allows it to have incredible drive when working in the field, yet also be perfectly content lying by the fire in the evening.]
